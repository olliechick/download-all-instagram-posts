# Download all Instagram posts
Download all posts from an Instagram account.

## Run instructions

Install dependencies and run the program.
You will be prompted to enter a username, then all of that user's posts will be downloaded to the `output` directory.

The most recent list of posts will be saved to a `posts.json` file. To re-download those files, enter a `.` instead of a username.
